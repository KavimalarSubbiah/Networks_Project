## Abstract:

This project aims to develop a robust multimedia multicasting system that facilitates the continuous transmission of data from various stations, emulating real-world broadcasting paradigms such as television and radio. In the proposed system, clients initiate engagement by sending a join request, after which, via TCP, the server provides vital details like station lists and site information. Continuous data broadcast is maintained by all stations, ensuring uninterrupted service akin to conventional broadcasting mechanisms. The system is designed to be user-centric, allowing receivers to connect to specific stations for live-streaming videos and offering functionalities like pause, resume, station-switching, and termination through a thread-managed Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project underscores the combination of reliability with user flexibility, aiming to enhance the overall experience of multimedia reception over IP.
